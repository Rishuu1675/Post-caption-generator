This is a small backend service that allows users to sign up, log in with a username and password, and generate captions for images they want to post. After authentication, users can send image details to the API and receive an automatically generated caption, making it easier to write posts for social media or other platforms. The project focuses on basic authentication, clean API structure, and a simple caption generation flow that can be extended or integrated with any frontend.
